question: What’s my definition of “done”?

To me, “done” means more than “it works.” A feature is done when the UI feels intuitive, the code is clean and maintainable, edge cases are handled, and performance is dialed in. If I wouldn’t feel confident handing it off to someone else or shipping it to production, it’s not done yet.
