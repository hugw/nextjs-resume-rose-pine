Hello! I’m a dedicated Software Engineer with a deep focus on Frontend development and a strong interest in building fast, accessible, and modern web interfaces.

With over a decade of hands-on experience, I’ve contributed to a range of products across companies like CodeReach Labs, SyntaxField, and currently, NebulaStack. My work centers around React, Astro, and TypeScript, with an emphasis on performance, maintainability, and developer experience.

At NebulaStack, I’ve led key frontend initiatives, from migrating legacy systems to modern frameworks, to architecting component libraries that streamline feature development across teams. I take pride in writing thoughtful, scalable code and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the browser.

I’m constantly exploring new frontend patterns, tools, and workflows, and enjoy diving deep into the details to solve hard problems. Whether it’s optimizing a Lighthouse score or rethinking UI state management, I’m all about clean solutions that hold up over time.
